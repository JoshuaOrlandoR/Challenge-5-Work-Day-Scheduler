# Challenge-5-Work-Day-Scheduler
For this challenge, I am tasked with building a calendar application by modifying existing starter code. The code in this assignment will be dynamically updated using third-party APIs like jQuery and moment.js
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Description
Using third-party API's, I created (using existing starter code) what is essentially an agenda. 
This application displays the current time through the use of moment.js. By using this API, I was also able to color-code blocks of time, relative to the live time. 
This application also allows users to type, store, and display text through the use of the local storage. Users can type whatever they want in an associated time block, and that text will still be there on page load!
